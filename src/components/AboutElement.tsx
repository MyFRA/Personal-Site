                <p className="text-justify leading-relaxed text-gray-600 font-inter">Hello, I'm Tomy Wibowo</p>
                <p className="mt-3 text-justify leading-relaxed text-gray-600 font-inter">I am a Fullstack Web & Android Developer with 3+ years of experience in the professional industry. I am currently 21 years old from Purbalingga, Indonesia</p>
                <p className="mt-3 text-justify leading-relaxed text-gray-600 font-inter">The reason I like technology, especially in the field of programming, is that with programming I can make my ideas come true. Apart from that, I also like solving problems and I feel challenged by that.</p>
                <p className="mt-3 text-justify leading-relaxed text-gray-600 font-inter">Apart from programming, I also like reading books and writing. Because reading can increase my knowledge regarding things outside of programming, lately I like writing a diary because by writing a diary I can immortalize moments and I can also carry out daily evaluations.</p>
